                <dd>This is my favorite Scout location. Plenty of parking in the plaza and the surrounding area. There are lots of good things in the surrounding plaza and across the street too. This location is very close to the campus and is almost always busy. There lots of space inside and out and the staff is very friendly and can handle the high volume. We got a cheddar and bacon scone , blueberry muffin, matcha Latte, woodlands latte. The cheddar scone was awesome and the muffin was good as well. Matcha was good but slightly milky in flavor. The Almond milk latte I got was their Homemade woodlands flavor. It was a mix of maple , citrus and Douglas Fir. Like as in the tree. I know it sounds crazy, but it was actually subtle and pleasant. I enjoyed the flavor all the way to the bottom of the cup. I also went there another day for a winter seasonal and got the maple and sea salt latte which was great as well. This is my most favorite location and will keep coming back for more.

                <dd>Great local spot to grab some good coffee, and a pastry or their delicious scout cookie, and relax into the slo vibe. Fairly consistently busy wth college crowd but only really really busy at peak times like morning, lunch, and early afternoon. Good service and decent seating indoor and out. Great spot to sit solo and do some work on the laptop or meet a friend. Also pretty average prices. Much prefer Scout than starbucks..</dd>
                <dd>Nice coffee shop with a young vibe. Plenty of parking here. Bakery items are very fresh. The music is soft so conversations aren't at shouting levels. I recommend getting your morning experience here!</dd>

                <dd>I have been going to this coffee shop for over 5 years. I like to support local businesses and havenâ€™t had any issues until recently. For the past two days, I have gone to scouts for my morning coffee. I have had to wait 20-30 min for an iced latte each time. Three other people and myself were all waiting for the same amount of time and all of us were pretty unhappy.

                    Staff is friendly but no sense of urgency at the foothill location. The downtown location seems to move faster. Definitely some room for improvement. Hopefully this can be improved.</dd>

                <dd>The gentleman making the latte's misread the ticket and made it for there as opposed to go, no big deal. However, instead of pouring it to go OR remaking it; he decided it was smart to add additional frothed milk on top to try to pass it off as made appropriately as opposed to staying true to flavor and correct ingredient measurements. The lady next to him asked if he re-made it and he laughed and said no, so it was acknowledged it should have been re-made. Considering its a relatively slow Tuesday at 10am, I would be very wary to come here on a weekend or early morning rush.

                    The pourover Ethiopia coffee lacks any hint of the intended notes, not sure if they're using old coffee or what but it's quite flavorless for this bean. The lady taking the order was friendly so added a star for her, otherwise it's a single star for quality.</dd>

                <dd>Do not come here to study!

                    After paying for my coffee I asked for the wifi password and was surprised to find out that they're not giving it out anymore.
                    
                    Though I understand why they may not want people using their tables for long periods of time, the simple fact is that people go to coffee shops to do work or study, particularly in a college town. I know that is the only reason why I paid for their extremely mediocre coffee. Any coffee shop in SLO will have lots of people staying there to do work and I will be taking my business there.</dd>
