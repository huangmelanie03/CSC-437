                <dd>I came in yesterday morning with a difficult group Molly took our order and was very patient and kind. We have never come to a Philz Coffee before, menu was confusing but she explained everything and suggested I try the Mocha Tesora Philz way.
                    She made the drinks for us and told us to make sure they are perfect. Coffee was great. As a first timer at Philz Coffee, we will be back. Thanks Molly!</dd>

                <dd>The coffee here is unique, but delicious. I ordered the ether with medium cream and medium sweetness. It was perfect and I didn't feel like I was just drinking sugar. The barista called my name and had me take a sip first to see if I liked it, I think that is great customer service. Its very simplistic and clean inside. I am eager to try something new the next time I stop by.</dd>
                <dd>We came on their third day of opening (black Friday) at around 11:30am and the line was out the door. It took us 1 hour to get in and out. About 40 mins to get to the front of the line to order and another 20 mins to get our one drink. Be prepared to wait in line since they just opened! It seems like some coffee baristas were a lot slower to making orders than others.

                    Otherwise. The space is nice! There's seating all around with outlets. Everyone is friendly! We will definitely try to do a mobile order next time.</dd>

                <dd>I love that a Philz opened in between city locations. Downside of it is that it's very busy. Not sure if it is because it just opened but waiting 15mins to order and then another 30mins for the drink is not something I will wanna wait for. So if you plan to get coffee here, expect an hour. We even tried to order through the app but it noted 1 hour pick up time.

                    The worst part... they lost the ticket to make the coffee. Until we said something, they made it right away but waiting in hour just for coffee? I'll pass. Aside from the wait, drink was the same.
                    
                    Other locations don't take this long.</dd>

                <dd>Every time I visit this location I order the same thing and the coffee is inconsistent. Sometimes it's amazing and other times it's awful. There's also a timing issue with the app because I'll order ahead of time, I'll get the notification that my coffee is ready and then I still have to wait inside for my order. Normally I wouldn't mind that but the staff is just rude and unfriendly when you ask for your coffee. Such a bummer because Philz used to be my favorite coffee.</dd>

                <dd>Came back to give Philz another try around 130pm today and it took 46min to get our drinks! Only 4 coffees! It should never ever take 46min to get coffee! I'm rooting for you guys man. We need you guys around here but 46min is just ridiculous. Please get it together guys</dd>
