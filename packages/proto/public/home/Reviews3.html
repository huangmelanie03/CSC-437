                <dd>I had their blackberry lavender matcha which was delicious! I have also tried and liked their flat white and an ube iced latte. Wide selection of flavors, peaceful interior, and friendly and helpful staff! Free chocolate espresso beans with every drink :) inside it's so light and airy.</dd>

                <dd>$3.25 for a tasty 12 oz. drip coffee...</dd>
                <dd>OMG the chocolate croissant was the most amazing thing ever!!!  My drink was ok. I asked for a recommendation, and I didn't care for it. To each his own. Definitely a cute spot! Employees were incredibly friendly and helpful!</dd>

                <dd>Nice trendy Caf√© with outside seating, parking in front of it and very tasty pastries. Capucino done in mid 20th style with thick foam and cacao on top instead of modern late art - not my thing but the coffee is surely good quality nonetheless.</dd>

                <dd>Went here the other day after a haircut. I got a large double shot almond milk latte. I was told it was going to be 6$, but didn't see an option to tip. When I got home I found they added their own 3$ tip, as my bank says I was charged 9$.

                    The coffee was good but I'm definitely not going back. Make sure to check your receipts!</dd>
