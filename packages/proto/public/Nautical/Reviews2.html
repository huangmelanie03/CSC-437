                <dd>Nautical Bean has been one of my favorite coffee houses for a few years now. Our drinks were made correctly according to our requests and the service was top notch. The bagel with cream cheese was hot and delicious. Employee that brought my bagel over to my table noticed I had a frequent flyer punchcard sitting out and offered to punch it for me. She took it, punched it and brought it back. Great customer service. I also love the vibe and decor inside. They have three locations and I have had good experience at all three.</dd>
                <dd>Absolutely love the atmosphere and the coffee was great. Definitely a must see place when visiting the area.</dd>

                <dd>Nice selection of coffee and Pastries, plenty of seats and areas with different themes. Okay service, good prices. Lots of folks studying. Cool country squire in the parking lot</dd>
                <dd>I got a vanilla latte from here which was decent but it definitely tasted more like artificial syrup. I wouldnt expect fancy latte art. I like the atmosphere and how colorful the coffee shop is but in my opinion, I wouldn't specifically crave the espresso here. It also took quite a while for my latte to be finished. However, a large is $5.50 so I really can't complain. I would stop here just for quick drip coffee or to chat with friends.</dd>

                <dd>The blue berry scone was missing the blue berry flavor. It was too moist for a scone. Just did not love the wrap. My fault not theirs. Grill veggies I assumed was an assortment of grilled veggies. Turns out it is peppers and onions … when you have the eggs and avocado removed you just do not have much to work with. Next time I will ask. #allergygirl was disappointed!</dd>

                <dd>Came in and ordered a breakfast burrito on 8/10/24 not a particularly busy morning at all. 37 minutes later went up and asked if the food was close to being done. They had no idea that we had ordered and paid for food. Ticket was not sent to the kitchen. No apologies or explanations just told to wait and that they would get it started and bring it to us. Brought it over 15 minutes later, again no apologies. Food was okay but not a 45 minute wait okay. Staff was rude and seemed inconvenienced that we had ordered food AND coffees.</dd>

                <dd>My partner and I went to the Nautical Bean on Parker St. When we got to the register, the first thing I asked was if any food on the menu was vegan(there was not). The cashier was very helpful and suggested the Mediterranean sandwich, subbing out the cream cheese with hummus to make it vegan. I ordered a large matcha latte with oat milk as well. We got our drink first. After a couple of sips, we could tell that they used regular milk instead of oat milk. I brought the drink back and they apologized and replaced it with my correct order. After about 30 minutes, we got our food and we were very excited. The excitement quickly died down when we saw that they had actually just used cream cheese instead of the hummus. I brought the food back and asked that it be replaced with my correct order once again. We were on a time limit and still hadn’t gotten our food yet, which was a bagel with hummus, onion, avocado, cucumber, tomato, and olive oil. My partner went to the register to just ask for a refund since we had been there for a while now and we had to get going. When my partner walked over to the register, they saw our newly made food on the inside of the counter and a worker just standing and chatting with another worker who was cleaning up. There was no sense of urgency. Overall just disappointed and if you have dietary restrictions, beware.</dd>
